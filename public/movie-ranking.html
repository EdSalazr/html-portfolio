<h1>THE BEST MOVIES EDWAR SALAZAR HAS SEEN</h1>

<h2> My top three movies of all time</h2>

<hr />  

<h3>Mr. Nobody</h3>
<p>This movie is very unique since it starts a little futuristic but has a lot of drama, comedy, action<br />
    suspense and at the end of the movie, it gave us as lot of knowledge regarding to carpe diem and also<br />
    that everything in life happens for something but being responsable for the results of our actions and choises.</p>

<h3>The Incredibles</h3>
<p>This movie is one of my favourites of all time just starting by the soundtrack of the movie, which is very jazzy and<br />
    fun to hear. The animations are incredible and the timing the movie has related to the soundtrack its astonishing.<br />
    I would see this movie as many times as it's possible to whach it.</p>

<h3>Cloud Atlas</h3>
<p>This movie it's one of those movies that you get very confuse at the begging of it because there<br />
    are a lot of different things happening at the same time but as the movie passes by, you'll confirm<br />
    that everything it's connected in between, just like the butterfly effect but at the same time in<br />
    different times, just incredible writting.<p>
